Labs and other reading stuff from [Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches, Third Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition). Both this
and [sequel](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-toolmaking-in-a-month-of-lunches?query=powershell%20tool) are highly recommended!

## Reasoning

This is not an official companion or anything of the sort -- rather this is mine reading journal
together with the solutions of labs. Please keep in mind that while I was using the book obviously,
I was not very good in copying the data, rather rethinking or reformulating as much as I could. Also
there are no lab answers from the book -- these are mine, and as such could include lots of bugs,
misunderstandings and non-related stuff. BUT this makes it legally free and public domaing.

## Format

I try to keep going with some consitent format, but it's not the priority here so do not rely on it 
too much when reading/parsing. At the moment it's one of markdown, I may move to .org later.
